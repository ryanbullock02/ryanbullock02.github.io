# About Me
## Most of my coding knowledge is from the C++ classes I've taken so far though my knowledge about app development is very near 0. I have taken a Java class but to be honest its not really my preferred language.

## My Interests
     - My interests are primarily video games in 3D printing, I've worked in CAM for a manufacturing company for a few years now so while it blends work and home interests I still enjoy my time.

## Websites I recommend

     [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com) - Thingiverse is a site where a lot of people have uploaded a lot of cool STLs that are free to use mainly for 3D printing.
     
     [GeeksforGeeks](www.geeksforgeeks.org) - As a computer science student GeeksforGeeks has a lot of easily digestible information where I find that stackoverflow can be a bit too highlevel sometimes.
